# MUSE Weak Lensing

## Install

Only dependencies you need in your global Python environment:
```
pip install poetry poetry_kernel
```

Then check out the repo (everything will be installed in its own virtual environment):
```
git clone https://github.com/marius311/muse-wl
cd muse-wl
poetry install
```

Then run the notebook (with the Poetry kernel which was installed above).
